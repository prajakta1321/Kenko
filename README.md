🏥 🎯   **Kenko: Individual’s Health Consumption Prediction Using Machine Learning**

📖 **Project Overview:**

Kenko is a machine learning project aimed at predicting an individual’s health consumption patterns based on various factors, including demographic data, lifestyle choices, and medical history. The goal of this project is to provide insights that can help in personalized healthcare recommendations and better resource allocation in healthcare systems.

🛠️ **Technologies Used**

Programming Language: Python
Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab

📊 **Data Collection**

The project utilizes a self created dataset containing information on health consumption behaviors, including:

Demographic details (age, gender)
Lifestyle choices (diet, exercise, smoking, etc.)
 
🧠 **Machine Learning Techniques**

The project implements various machine learning algorithms, including:

Regression Models: To estimate health consumption costs based on input features.
Classification Algorithms: To categorize individuals into different health consumption brackets.
Clustering: To identify patterns and segments in health consumption behavior.

🔍 **Key Features**

Predictive analytics to forecast future health consumption.
Visualization of data trends and insights for better understanding.
A user-friendly interface for healthcare professionals to make informed decisions.
